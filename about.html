      <p>
        Cooper Sullivan Marcus is an ex-scientist turned scholar of letters originally from San Francisco and as of recently based in Brooklyn, New York. While receiving a bachelor's degree in physics from Reed College, where they devoted a year-long thesis to computer-generated holograms, Cooper was initiated into the study and practice of calligraphy. They were awarded a grant to explore the letter “g” along the rocky shores of the united kingdom, and have continued to practice the ancient arts of the written word ever since. Upon graduation, they began working behind the scenes for a tech company creating solid state lidar devices in San Francisco, although they never ceased nourishing their interests in craft, letter-writing, and time-based process arts. After a few years, they decided to devote more of their time to this, and joined the Curatorial team of the Letterform Archive. Other projects include stewarding the GLBTHS archive and data editing for Fonts In Use. Shortly after undertaking a masters degree in Library Sciences, Cooper said a temporary goodbye to their home of 25+ years to explore new horizons in the big apple.
